# HerVision

### HerVision is a mobile app to help Aritzia customers across the globe cultivate their personal style and inspire each other.
I made this iOS application with Shadan Namazifard, Lavanya Kandhari and Hannah Baek at the UBC girlCode x Aritzia hackathon. Check out our quick demo below!

## What it does
HerVision helps Aritzia customers build their personal style by allowing them to add pieces to their Wardrobe. Essentially, users can mix and match the tops and bottoms in their Wardrobe to build outfits. Our hope is that this helps users buy pieces that style well with what they already own. HerVision also features an Explore page where users can upload pictures of their own outfits. The idea here is to feel empowered by sharing your creativity with the Aritzia community. Users who are seeking to build their style can come to this page to be inspired by their community. On the explore page, users can also search for images including specific items that they want to see.

## What's next 
Our next step would be to incorporate ML into this program. We are currently considering how we could integrate an algorithm that learns about a user’s preferences (based on their Wardrobe, interactions, etc.) and then better curates their Explore page. We would also like to expand upon the community aspect of the app by allowing users to make accounts so that they can interact with each others’ outfit posts (e.g. through likes and comments). To make a coherent e-commerce experience, we would also link these accounts to the existing ones on the Aritzia website, so your cart and wishlist are consistent between HerVision and the Aritzia website.
